This directory contains all that's needed to build an F# version of the
F* application library (alib) in order to build F# applications. This is
currently not tested by anything in this repository.

The output of this build goes into the bin/ and nuget/ subdirectories.
Run `make lib-fsharp` from the top level to extract the library and
build it (this is implied by `make all`).
