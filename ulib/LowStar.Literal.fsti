/// This module enables clients to make use of string literals in Low* as
/// shorthand syntax for immutable, always-live uint8 buffers. See
/// LowStar.printf for writing and printing string literals.

/// .. note::
///
///    This module supersedes ``C.String``.

/// As a reminder, the F* compiler enforces that string literals are UTF-8
/// encoded, and list_of_string returns the corresponding sequence of Unicode
/// scalar values (see https://erratique.ch/software/uucp/doc/Uucp.html#uminimal) for an excellent
/// crash course on Unicode.

/// When compiling with KreMLin, string literals are printed as series of bytes,
/// where non-alphanumeric characters are hex-encoded. For instance, if after reading
/// the C standard, the user writes ``let x = "ðŸ¤®"``, then KreMLin will generate
/// ``const char *x = "\xf0\x9f\xa4\xae"``.

/// String literals as buffers
/// --------------------------

/// Therefore, in order to talk about the interpretation of a string literal as
/// a series of bytes, we need to define the serialization of Unicode scalar values
/// (as returned by ``String.list_of_string``) into bytes. This is a commendable and
/// noble goal, but instead, we choose to restrict ourselves to the ASCII subset of
/// UTF-8, where the byte encoding of a scalar value is the identity.
