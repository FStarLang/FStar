to control their normalization or to generate code. *)

(* Functional dependencies of a class. It takes an int list
representing the arguments of the class (starting from 0, both explicit
and implicit alike) that are dependent on the rest. When trying to apply
an instance, if the fundeps are unresolved (i.e. contain uvars) but the
other arguments do not, we will apply the instance and instantiate the
fundeps. *)

run this tactics without having to know its definition in the .fst *)

declaration. *)
