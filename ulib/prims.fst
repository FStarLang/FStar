module Prims

/// This module is implicitly opened in the scope of all other modules.

(***** Begin trusted primitives *****)

(** Primitives up to the definition of the GTot effect are trusted
    Beyond that all definitions are fully verified *)


(** Type of attributes *)
assume new
type attribute : Type0 

(** An attribute indicating that some definition must be processed by the
    Dijkstra monads for free construction *)
assume
val cps:attribute

(** A predicate to express when a type supports decidable equality
    The type-checker emits axioms for [hasEq] for each inductive type *)
assume
type hasEq : Type -> GTot Type0 

(** A convenient abbreviation, [eqtype] is the type of types in
    universe 0 which support decidable equality *)
type eqtype = a: Type0{hasEq a}

(** [bool] is a two element type with elements [true] and [false]. We
    assume it is primitive, for convenient interop with other
    languages, although it could easily be defined as an inductive type
    with two cases, [BTrue | BFalse] *)
assume new
type bool : eqtype 

(** [c_False] is the empty inductive type. The type with no
    inhabitants represents logical falsehood. Note, [c_False] is
    seldom used directly in F*. We instead use its "squashed" variant,
    [False], see below. *)
type c_False = 

(** [c_True] is the singleton inductive type---it is trivially
    inhabited. Like [c_False], [c_True] is seldom used. We instead use
    its "squashed" variants, [True] *)
type c_True = | T

(** [unit]: another singleton type, with its only inhabitant written [()]
    we assume it is primitive, for convenient interop with other languages *)
assume new
type unit : eqtype 

(** [squash p] is a central type in F*---[squash p] is the proof
    irrelevant analog of [p] and is represented as a unit
    refinement. Squashed proofs are typically discharged using an SMT
    solver, without expliciltly reconstructed any proof terms. As
    such, one way to think of [squash p] is as the type of properties
    proven using classical axioms without building proof terms.

    Note, [squash p] is just a unit refinement, it resides in universe
    0, lowering the universe of [p]. From this perspective, one may
    also see [squash] as a coercion down to universe 0.

    The type is marked [tac_opaque] to indicate to Meta-F* that
    instances of [squash] should not be unfolded when evaluating
    tactics (since many optimizations in F*'s SMT encoding rely
    specifically on occurrences of [squash].

    See FStar.Squash for various ways of manipulating squashed
    types. *)
[@@ "tac_opaque"]
type squash (p: Type) : Type0 = x: unit{p}

(** [auto_squash] is equivalent to [squash]. However, F* will
    automatically insert `auto_squash` when simplifying terms,
    converting terms of the form `p /\ True` to `auto_squash p`.

    We distinguish these automatically inserted squashes from explicit,
    user-written squashes.

    A user should not have to manipulate [auto_squash] at all, except
    in rare circumstances when writing tactics to process proofs that
    have already been partially simplified by F*'s simplifier.
*)
let auto_squash (p: Type) = squash p

(** The [logical] type is transitionary. It is just an abbreviation
    for [Type0], but is used to classify uses of the basic squashed
    logical connectives that follow. Some day, we plan to remove the
    [logical] type, replacing it with [prop] (also defined below).

    The type is marked [private] to intentionally prevent user code
    from referencing this type, hopefully easing the removal of
    [logical] in the future. *)

    such symbols are used in patterns *)

    equality, below. *)

(** [eq2] is the squashed version of [equals]. It's a proof
   irrelevant, homogeneous equality in Type#0 and is written with
   an infix binary [==].

   TODO: instead of hard-wiring the == syntax,
         we should just rename eq2 to op_Equals_Equals
*)

    reflexivity proofs at a given type, as with [equals]. *)

    written with an infix binary [<<].

    The [<<] order includes:

    It is sometimes convenient, e.g., when writing triggers for
    quantifiers, to have access to this relation at the source
    level. The [has_type] predicate below reflects the SMT encodings
    [HasType] relation. We also use it to define the type [prop] or
    proof irrelevant propositions, below.

    Note, unless you have a really good reason, you probably don't
    want to use this [has_type] predicate. F*'s type theory certainly
