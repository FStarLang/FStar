    Note: We use an uncurried [snoc (l, x)] instead of the curried
    [snoc l x]. This is intentional. If [snoc] takes a pair instead
    of 2 arguments, it allows for a better pattern on
    [lemma_unsnoc_snoc], which connects [snoc] and [unsnoc]. In
    particular, if we had two arguments, then either the pattern would
    either be too restrictive or would lead to over-triggering. More
    context for this can be seen in the (collapsed and uncollapsed)
