(* NOTE: You probably want inspect/pack from FStar.Tactics, which work
 * over a fully named representation. If you use these, you have to
 * work with de Bruijn indices (using Tv_BVar). The only reason these
 * two exists is that they can be made Tot, and hence can be used in
 * specifications. *)

(** "Inspecting" a term: reveal one level of its syntax via the type
term_view.

Crucially, this function guarantees that the result "precedes" the
argument, since it is morally exposing the subterms of [t] in the view.
This can be justified by this model of [term] and [term_view]:

  type term = | Pack of term_view
  let pack_ln = Pack
  let inspect_ln (Pack tv) = tv

Where inspect_ln would give exactly this guarantee on its result. Of
course, the [term] type is actually implemented via internal F* terms,
but the inspect and pack should be consistent with this model.
