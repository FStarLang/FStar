(* The DMFF-generated `bind_wp` doesn't the contain the "don't

 *
 * Plus, we don't need to model the ranges and depths: they make no
 * difference since the proofstate type is abstract and the SMT never
 * sees a concrete one.
 *
 * So, override `bind_wp` for the effect with an efficient one.

(* A hook to postprocess a definition, after typechecking, and rewrite
 * it into a (provably equal) shape chosen by the user. This can be used
 * to implement custom transformations previous to extraction, such as
 * selective inlining. When ran added to a definition [let x = E], the
 * [tau] metaprogram is presented with a goal of the shape [E == ?u] for
 * a fresh uvar [?u]. The metaprogram should then both instantiate [?u]
 * and prove the equality. *)
