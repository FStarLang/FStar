module FStar.ReflexiveTransitiveClosure

/// This module defines the reflexive transitive closure of a
/// relation. That is, the smallest preorder that includes it.
///
/// Closures are convenient for defining monotonic memory references:
///
/// - Define a `step` relation and take `closure step` as the
///   monotonic relation of the reference.
///
/// - To witness a property of the value of the reference, one must
///   show that the property is stable with respect to `closure step`,
///   but this boils down to proving that is stable with respect to
///   `step` (see lemma `stable_on_closure` below).
///
/// See examples/preorder/Closure.fst for usage examples.
