   This module provides an erased type
   to abstract computationally irrelevant values.

   It relies on the GHOST effect defined in Prims.

   [erased a] is decorated with the erasable attribute
   As such,

   1. The type is considered non-informative.
      So, [Ghost (erased a)] can be subsumed to [Pure (erased a)]

   2. The compiler extracts [erased a] to [unit]

   The type is [erased a] is in a bijection with [a],
   as witnessed by the [hide] and [reveal] function.

   Importantly, computationally relevant code cannot use [reveal]
     (it's marked GTot)

   Just like Coq's prop, it is okay to use erased types
   freely as long as we produce an erased type.
