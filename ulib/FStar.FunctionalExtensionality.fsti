module FStar.FunctionalExtensionality

/// Functional extensionality asserts the equality of pointwise-equal
/// functions.
///
/// The formulation of this axiom is particularly subtle in F* because
/// of its interaction with subtyping. In fact, prior formulations of
/// this axiom were discovered to be unsound by Aseem Rastogi.
///
/// The predicate [feq #a #b f g] asserts that [f, g: x:a -> (b x)] are
/// pointwise equal on the domain [a].
///
/// However, due to subtyping [f] and [g] may also be defined on some
/// domain larger than [a]. We need to be careful to ensure that merely
/// proving [f] and [g] equal on their sub-domain [a] does not lead us
/// to conclude that they are equal everywhere.
///
/// For more context on how functional extensionality works in F*, see
///   1. tests/micro-benchmarks/Test.FunctionalExtensionality.fst
///   2. ulib/FStar.Map.fst and ulib/FStar.Map.fsti
///   3. Issue #1542 on github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues/1542

(** [on_domain a f]:

    This is a key function provided by the module. It has several
    features.

    1. Intuitively, [on_domain a f] can be seen as a function whose
       maximal domain is [a].

    2. While, [on_domain a f] is proven to be *pointwise* equal to [f],
       crucially it is not provably equal to [f], since [f] may
       actually have a domain larger than [a].

    3. [on_domain] is idempotent

    4. [on_domain a f x] has special treatment in F*'s normalizer. It
        reduces to [f x], reflecting the pointwise equality of
        [on_domain a f] and [f].

    5. [on_domain] is marked [inline_for_extraction], to eliminate the
        overhead of an indirection in extracted code. (This feature
        will be exercised as part of cross-module inlining across
        interface boundaries)

     Though stated indirectly, [is_restricted a f] is valid when [f]
     is a function whose maximal domain is equal to [a].

     Equivalently, one may see its definition as
        [exists g. f == on_domain a g]
