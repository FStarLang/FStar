module LowStar.ConstBuffer

(* This module provides a model of const pointers in C.

   A well-typed client guarantees that it will not mutate memory
   through a const pointer. But it cannot rely on the context not
   mutating the same memory.

   As such, we model const pointers as a finite disjunction of
   {mutable, immutable}-pointers, forcing code to guarantee the
   strongest condition of the two (immutability) and to rely only on
   the weakest (i.e., mutability).

   The main type of this module is `const_buffer t`. It is extracted
   by KreMLin to  `const t*`.

/// Discussion between NS and JP (20191119)
///
/// Why is it safe to generate C code that casts away the const qualifier with the
/// cast operations below? Looking at the C11 standard, 6.7.3 alinea 6:
///
/// > If an attempt is made to modify an object defined with a const-qualified type
/// > through useof an lvalue with non-const-qualified type, the behavior is
/// > undefined.
///
/// So, dangerous things happen in situations where the original object is *created*
/// with a const qualifier (the object's _identity_ is const).
///
/// ```
/// #include <stdio.h>
/// #include <stdlib.h>
///
/// extern void f(const int *x);
///
/// int main() {
///   const int x = 0;
///   f(&x); // f promises not to modify x
///   printf("%d\n", x); // prints 0 at -O3 but 1 at -O0
///   return 0;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// with:
///
/// ```
/// void f(const int *x) {
///   int *y = (int *)x;
///   *y = 1;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In Low*, however, we never create objects that are marked const from the start.
/// This is for historical reasons; in particular, immutable buffers are not marked
/// const (they certainly could be).
///
/// So, the casts seem to be safe? Also, the difference in behavior noted above
/// does not happen if x is defined as
///
/// ```
///   const int *x = calloc(1, sizeof *x);
/// ```
///
/// Finally, the compiler, if the const qualifier is stripped from x, could still
/// potentially rely on an argument of freshness (pointer provenance?) to deduce
/// that &x is the sole pointer to x and that therefore the value of x should remain
/// the same. This does not seem to be happening.

///  a mutable or immutable pointer, in case the context can prove
