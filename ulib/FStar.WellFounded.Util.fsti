(** Provides some utilities related to well-founded relations *)

(* 1. Given a well-founded relation `r:binrel a`
      turn it into a well-founded relation on `binrel top`, 
      by construction a relation that only relates `top` elements
      in `a` by `r`

      This is useful when writing type-polymorphic recursive functions
      whose termination depends on some custom well-founded order

(* 2. Given a well-founded relation `r:binrel a`
      turn it into a *squashed* well-founded relation on `binrel top`, 
      by construction a relation that only relates `top` elements
      in `a` by `r`

      This is very similar to 1, but uses squashed types,
      which leads to slightly better SMT automation at use sites.
