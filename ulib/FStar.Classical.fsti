module FStar.Classical

/// This module provides various utilities to manipulate the squashed
/// logical connectives [==>], [/\], [\/], [forall], [exists] and [==],
/// defined in Prims in terms of the [squash] type. See Prims and
/// FStar.Squash for basic explanations of the [squash] type.
///
/// In summary:
///
/// - [squash p] is proof-irrelevant proof of [p], expressed as a unit
///   refinement.
///
/// - [Lemma p] is also a proof-irrelevant proof of [p], expressed as
///   a postcondition of a unit-returning Ghost computation.
///
/// We provide several utilities to turn proofs of various
/// propositions with non-trivial proof terms into proof-irrelevant,
/// classical proofs.

(**** Implication *)

(** Turning an [a ==> b] into a [squash a -> squash b]. Note [a ==> b] is

    : Lemma (p ==> q ())

(**** Universal quantification *)

/// Many of the utilities for universal quantification are designed to
/// help in the proofs of lemmas that ensure quantified
/// postconditions. For example, in order to prove [Lemma (forall
/// (x:a). p x)] it is often useful to "get your hands" on a freshly
/// introduced variable [x] and to prove [p x] for it, i.e., to prove
/// [x:a -> Lemma (p x)] and to turn this into a proof for [forall
/// x. p x]. Functions like [forall_intro] in this module let you do
/// just that.
///
/// That said, it may often be more convenient to prove such
/// properties using local lemmas in inner scopes. For example, here
/// are two proof sketches for [forall x. p x].
///
/// {[
///    assume
///    val p : nat -> prop
///
///    let proof1 =
///      let lem (x:nat)
///        : Lemma (ensures p x)
///        = admit()
///      in
///      forall_intro lem;
///      assert (forall x. p x)
///
///    let proof2 =
///      let lem (x:nat)
///        : Lemma (ensures p x)
///                [SMTPat (p x)]
///        = admit()
///      in
///      assert (forall x. p x)
/// ]}
///
/// In [proof1], we prove an auxiliary lemma [lem] and then use
/// [forall_intro] to turn it into a proof of [forall x. p x].
///
/// In [proof2], we simply decorate [lem] with an SMT pattern to
/// allow the solver to use that lemma to prove [forall x. p x]
/// directly.
///
/// The style of [proof2] is often more robust for several reasons:
///
///  - [forall_intro] only works with lemmas that do not have
///    preconditions. E.g., if you wanted to prove [forall x. q x ==>
///    p x], you would have had to prove [lem] with the type [x:nat ->
///    Lemma (q x ==> p x)]. In contrast, in the style of [proof2],
///    you could have proven [x:nat -> Lemma (requires q x) (ensures p
///    x)], which is easier, since you can assume the precondition [q
///    x]. To use this style of lemma-with-precondition with
///    [forall_intro], one typically must also use [move_requires] to
///    coerce a lemma with a precondition into a lemma proving an
///    implication, or to use [ghost_lemma].
///
///  - [forall_intro] introduces a quantifier without an SMT
///    pattern. This can pollute the local context with an unguarded
///    quantifier, leading to inefficient proofs. Note, the variants
///    [forall_intro_with_pat] help with this somewhat, but they only
///    support a single pattern, rather than conjunctive and
///    disjunctive patterns.
///
///  - [forall_intro] and its variants are available for only a fixed
///    arity up to 4. The nested SMTPat lemma style of [proof2] works
///    are arbitrary arity.
///
/// That said, there may still be cases where [forall_intro] etc. are
/// more suitable.

(** This function is almost identical to [forall_intro]. The only
    difference is that rather in [forall_intro f] the type of [f] is
    _unified_ with expected type of that argument, leading to better
    resolution of implicit variables.

    However, sometimes it is convenient to introduce a quantifier from
    a lemma while relying on subtyping---[forall_intro_sub f] allows
    the use of subtyping when comparing the type of [f] to the
    expected type of the argument. This will likely mean that the
    implicit arguments, notably [p], will have to be provided
    explicilty. *)

(**** Existential quantification *)

(** The most basic way to introduce a squashed existential quantifier
    [exists x. p x] is to present a witness [w] such that [p w].

    While [exists_intro] is very explicit, as with universal
    quantification and [forall_intro], it is only available for a
    fixed arity.

    However, unlike with we do not yet provide any conveniences for
    higher arities. One workaround is to tuple witnesses together,
    e.g., instead of proving [exists x y. p x y] to prove instead
    [exists xy. p (fst xy) (snd xy)] and to allow the SMT solver to convert
    the latter to the former. *)
