(** This private primitive is used internally by the compiler to
    translate character literals with a desugaring-time check of the
    size of the number, rather than an expensive verification check.
    Since it is marked private, client programs cannot call it
    directly Since it is marked unfold, it eagerly reduces,
    eliminating the verification overhead of the wrapper *)
