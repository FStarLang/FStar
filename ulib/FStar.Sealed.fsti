module FStar.Sealed

(* This module provides the type ``sealed a`` which is a singleton
   type from the perspective of F*'s logic. I.e., two values `x, y`
   both of type `sealed a` are provably equal.

   However, from the meta-F*, i.e., using the Tac effect, one can
   break the seal and extract an underlying value of type `a` from a
   `sealed a`.

   See also FStar.Sealed.Inhabited for a version of this module for
   use with inhabited types, in a style that is more efficient for
   SMT-based reasoning

assume
new type sealed ([@@@strictly_positive] a : Type u#aa) : Type u#0

(* The main axiom provided by this module:

   Two sealed values of the same type are equal.
   
   Their seal can be broken only at the meta level, by incurring a Tac effect.
   See FStar.Tactics.unseal
