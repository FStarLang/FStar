(*
 * AR: why do we need the first conjunct in the postcondition?
 *
 *  without this some proofs that use `assert e by t` fail
 *  the way `assert e by t` works is that, it is desugared into `with_tactic e t`
 *  that is abstract and remains in the VC as is at some point, we take a pass over
 *  the VC, find the `with_tactic e t` nodes in it, farm out `G |= e by t` where `G`
 *  is the context at that point in the VC in the original VC, `with_tactic e t`
 *  is simply replace by `True`.
 *  So why is it OK to replace it by `True`, don't we lose the fact that `e` holds for
 *  the rest of the VC?
 *  In the wp world of things, this works fine, since the wp of `assert e by t` is
 *  (fun _ -> with_tactic e t /\ (e ==> ...))
 *  i.e. the type of `assert e by t` already introduces a cut, so replacing it by
 *  `True` works fine.
 *
 *   But this doesn't work when we use the intricate `~ (wp (fun r -> r =!= x))`
 *   combinator to convert from wp to pre post
 *
 *   Basically, the shape of the VC in that case becomes:
 *     (with_tactic e t /\ (((~ with_tactic e t) \/ (e /\ ...)) ==> ...))
 *
 *   In this VC, if we replace the first `with_tactic e t` with `True`, for the second conjunct,
 *   the solver can no longer reason that the first disjunct cannot hold
 *
 *   The wp (fun _ -> True) below helps add that assumption to the second conjunct

(*
 * A polymonadic bind between DIV and MSTATE
 *
 * This is ultimately used when defining par and frame in Steel.Effect.fst (via NMST layer)
 * par and frame try to compose reified Steel with Steel, since Steel is non total, its reification
 *   incurs a Div effect, and so, we need a way to compose Div and Steel
 *
 * To do so, we have to go all the way down and have a story for MST and NMST too
 *
 * This polymonadic bind gives us bare minimum to realize that
 * It is quite imprecise, in that it doesn't say anything about the post of the Div computation
 * That's because, the as_ensures combinator is not encoded for Div effect in the SMT,
 *   the way it is done for PURE and GHOST
 *
 * However, since the reification use case gives us Dv anyway, this is fine for now
