/// This module provides a basic hashtable with no support for hash-collisions
///
/// In particular, if the table already contains a key k1 and the client calls `put`
///   with another key k2 that has a hash-collision with k1, then k1 is evicted from the table
///
/// The table is designed to support reference-like types as values,
///   in addition to the usual `key` and `value` type, the table is also indexed with a `contents` type
///   and a separation logic proposition (`vprop`) that relates a key, value,
///   and the content that the value may point to
///
/// The content of the value is erased, the table does not store any concrete contents
///
/// During `put` the client provides this `vprop` relating the key, value, and
///   the (erased) contents, and on `get`, the client gets it back
///
/// To account for these permissions, the table also maintains a ghost
///   map that maintains keys that have been read (or borrowed)
///
/// The module provides a logical view of the hashtable as a map from keys to contents,
///   thereby collapsing the indirection of key -> value -> content
///
/// The logical map provides a hash-collision-free view of the table,
///   in the example above, the map would contain both k1 and k2, with the mapping for k1 unchanged by the `put` operation on k2 (unless k1 == k2)
///
/// So in that sense, the concrete state maintains a partial view of the logical map
