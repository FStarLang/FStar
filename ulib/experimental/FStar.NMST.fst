(*
 * A polymonadic bind between DIV and NMSTATE
 *
 * This is ultimately used when defining par and frame in Steel.Effect.fst
 * par and frame try to compose reified Steel with Steel, since Steel is non total, its reification
 *   incurs a Div effect, and so, we need a way to compose Div and Steel
 *
 * To do so, we have to go all the way down and have a story for MST and NMST too
 *
 * This polymonadic bind gives us bare minimum to realize that
 * It is quite imprecise, in that it doesn't say anything about the post of the Div computation
 * That's because, the as_ensures combinator is not encoded for Div effect in the SMT,
 *   the way it is done for PURE and GHOST
 *
 * However, since the reification use case gives us Dv anyway, this is fine for now
