(** This module provides an array type, with fractional permissions based
    ownership over the entire array.

    This is non-selector variant of the Steel.Array library.
    
    A variant of it with splitting ownership over sub-arrays would be nice,
    but doesn't exist yet. *)

/// A big design decision in this library was whether the second index
/// of this predicate should be a [lseq t (length a)] or just a [seq t].

/// Making it an [lseq] forces every specification to be strongly
/// typed, in the sense that the logical representation of an array
/// has to be a sequence of the right length. This can be a little
/// cumbersome in specifications, particularly as the refinement appears
/// in some cases beneath the [erased] constructor.
///
/// So, we opted instead to let the index be just a [seq t], and
/// requiring length refinements on it in certain functions, only when
/// necessary.
