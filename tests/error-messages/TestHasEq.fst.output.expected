* Info at TestHasEq.fst(58,10-58,11):
  - Expected failure:
  - Failed to prove that the type
    'TestHasEq.t3'
    supports decidable equality because of this argument.
  - Add either the 'noeq' or 'unopteq' qualifier
  - The SMT solver could not prove the query. Use --query_stats for more
    details.
  - See also TestHasEq.fst(57,0-58,19)

* Info at TestHasEq.fst(85,7-85,8):
  - Expected failure:
  - Subtyping check failed
  - Expected type Prims.eqtype got type Type0
  - The SMT solver could not prove the query. Use --query_stats for more
    details.

* Info at TestHasEq.fst(88,8-89,30):
  - Expected failure:
  - Invalid qualifiers for declaration `type TestHasEq.erasable_t2`
  - The `unopteq` qualifier is not allowed on erasable inductives since they
    don't have decidable equality.
