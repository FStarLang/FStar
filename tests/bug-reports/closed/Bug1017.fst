module Bug1017

(* Should not be accepted, the body is still in `Tot` *)
[@@expect_failure [19]]
let rec loop (x : int) : Tot (int -> Dv int) = loop (x - 1)

(* Neither should this one. It also generates invalid OCaml: *)
(* > Error: This kind of expression is not allowed as right-hand side of `let rec' *)
[@@expect_failure [163]]
let rec loop2 : Tot (unit -> Dv unit) = loop2

(* This one is OK, as it will only diverge when applied *)
let rec ok (u:unit) : Dv unit = ok ()

(*
 * Causes normalizer to loop. And to use an increasing amount of heap,
 * so I suspect GC is not kicking in (separate issue?)
 *)
// let _ = assert_norm (loop 1 == ((fun x -> x) <: int -> Dv int))

(* This loops in extracted OCaml *)
// let y : int -> Dv int = loop 42
