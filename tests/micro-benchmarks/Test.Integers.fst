 This file demonstrates the overloading support for integers and
 machine integers provided by the FStar.Integers library and by a
 compiler option `--integer_overloading` for typing machine integer
 constants w.r.t this library

// A heuristic for unifying matches is key to making this work
// In particular, we can unify
//  `match ?u with | P1 -> t1 ... | Pn -> tn` with `s`
// by setting `?u := Pi`,
// whenever the head symbol of `ti` matches the head of `s`
// If no such branch exists, we try the branches in sequence
// trying to solve `ti ~ s` backtracking when it fails to try the next branch.
//
// This works well for in many simple cases, and also allows for
// several layers of overloading to be defined compositionally

/// This is a small example mimicing the essence of how FStar.Integers works

  match b with
  | true -> int
  | false -> string

/// And you can layer these indexed types, as usual
let t1 (x:option bool) =
  match x with
  | Some b -> t0 b
  | None -> unit
let f1 #i (x:t1 i) = ()
/// And the inference heuristic succeeds here, finding a branch that
/// matches the head symbol easily
let g1 (a: t0 true) = f1 a
let g2 (a: t0 false) = f1 a

/// But even when that's not the case, the backtracking search
/// succeeds in finding the needed instantiation

/// Unification picks the first branch of t1 and the head-matching
/// heuristic picks the first branch of t0
let g3 = f1 0

/// Unification picks the first branch of t1 and the head-matching
/// heuristic picks the second branch of t0
let g4 = f1 "hello"

/// The head-matching heuristic picks the 2nd branch of t1
let g5 = f1 ()

/// Without the head-matching heuristic, unification would pick the
/// first branch of t1, then the first branch of t0 & fail;
/// backtracks to the 2nd branch of t0 & fail; backtracks to the
/// the second branch of t1 and succeed.
///
/// Note, as with other uses of backtracking in the unification
/// algorithm, the search is local; if we find a solution a particular
/// problem instance, we commit to it immediately even if the chosen
/// solution is incompatible with other problems that may be in scope;
/// global backtracking is too expensive and unpredictable.
