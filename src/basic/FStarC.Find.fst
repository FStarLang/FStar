(* Find the Z3 executable that we should invoke for a given version.

- If the user provided the --smt option, use that binary unconditionally.
- We then look in $LIB/z3-VER/z3, where LIB is the F* library root, for example
  /usr/local/lib/fstar/z3-4.8.5/bin/z3, for an installed package. We ship Z3 4.8.5
  and 4.13.3 in the binary package in these paths, so F* automatically find them
  without relying on PATH or adding more stuff to the user's /usr/local/bin.
  Each $PREFIX/lib/fstar/z3-VER directory roughly contains an extracted Z3
  binary package, but with many files removed (currently we just keep LICENSE
  and the executable).

- Else we check the PATH:
  - If z3-VER (or z3-VER.exe) exists in the PATH use it.
  - Otherwise, default to "z3" in the PATH.

We cache the chosen executable for every Z3 version we've ran.
