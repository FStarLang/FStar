(* NB:
    Const_int (_, None) is not a canonical representation for a mathematical integer
    e.g., you can have both
    Const_int("0x3ffffff", None)
    and
    Const_int("67108863", None)
    which represent the same number
    You should do an "FStarC.Util.ensure_decimal" on the
    string representation before comparing integer constants.

    eq_const below does that for you
