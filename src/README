Most files in this folder are read and extracted by F* directly.  That is, they are written in the intersection of F* and F# and thus can be consumed by F# and F* indifferently.

A few files need more work:

- Files that are valid F#, and almost-valid F*
  These exist in e.g. src/tactics/boot.  They are massaged with sed and saved in src/boot/ as part of the build process.  There's both fsi files and fs files in this category.  These are stored in boot/ subfolders.

  Updates to these usually don't require anything special, except if you're writing in F#-only syntax (e.g. defining a type alias — you can't make that abstract in F#).  In that case, you can mark a line for deletion when processing boot/ subfolders by tagging it with // JUST FSHARP.

  New files in this category need to be listed in ALL_BOOT in the Makefile.

- Files that are realized in F# and OCaml separately
  These have native implementations in F# and OCaml, and an F#-friendly fsi.  In some cases, the fsi needs massaging, as explained above.  These too are stored in boot/ subfolders (but see below).  The ml realization is stored in either ulib/ml or src/**/ml.

  Updates to these require modifying three files: the fsi, the fs, and the ml implementation.  Usually, you'll want to update any corresponding files in ulib for consistency (e.g. the compiler doesn't use FStar.List.fst from ulib, because we don't extract ulib for bootstraping, but it's nice to keep FStar.List.fs in src consistent with FStar.List.fst in ulib. Same for FStar.String.fst.)

  New files in this category need to be listed in FSTAR_OBJS in src/ocaml-output/Makefile.

- Files that are realized in F# and OCaml separately with an interface in ulib
  Some files have a separate, hand-written fsti interface that we read from ulib.  These files are stored in fs/ subfolders, and only read by F#.

  Updates to these requires modifying four files: the fsi, the fs, the ml implementation in ulib, the fsti in ulib, and possibly the fst in ulib.


Another example, this time from the [Pprint] library. This is a different 
situation from [List] above, in that the F* file is just declaring types 
and function, we don't want to prove anything about the F* code, and the 
main implementations are the OCaml and F# ones: 
- prettyprint/prettyprint.fsti (F* interface file declaring types and functions);
- prettyprint/prettyprint.{fs,fsi} (F# implementation of the fsti interface);
- prettyprint/ml/FStar.Pprint.ml (OCaml implementation, has same module name as F* one)
To build this:
- Add the fsti file to src/Makefile's ALL_INTERFACES;
- Build the {fs,fsi} files as part of the VS solution;
- Add FStar_Pprint.cmx to src/ocaml-output/Makefile's FSTAR_OBJS.
