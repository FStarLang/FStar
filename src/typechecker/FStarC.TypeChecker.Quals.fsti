(*
Checking qualifiers **and attributes**. This is split in two functions,
_pre and _post, as some qualifier/attributes must be checked before the function
is typechecked (or at least it's better/faster to do so) and some can only be checked
after the function is typechecked.

Currently, the only things that must be checked after the function is typechecked are:
- The erasable attribute, since the defn must be elaborated. See #3253.
- The must_erase attribute
- The instance attribute for typeclasses
