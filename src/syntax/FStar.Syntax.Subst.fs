(* compress:
      This is used pervasively, throughout the codebase

      The recommended use for inspecting a term
      is to first call compress on it, which should
         1. push delayed substitutions down one level

         2. eliminate any top-level (Tm_uvar uv) node,
            when uv has been assigned a solution already

      `compress` should will *not* memoize the result of uvar
      solutions (since those could be reverted), nor the result
      of `push_subst` (since it internally uses the unionfind
      graph too).

      The function is broken into a fast-path where the
      result can be easily determined and a recursive slow
      path.

      Warning: if force_uvar changes to operate on inputs other than
      Tm_uvar then the fastpath out match in compress will need to be
      updated.

      This function should NEVER return a Tm_delayed. If you do any
      non-trivial change to it, it would be wise to uncomment the check
      below and run a full regression build.

(* deep_compress_*: eliminating all unification variables and
delayed substitutions in a sigelt. We traverse the entire syntactic
structure to evaluate the explicit lazy substitutions (Tm_delayed) and
to replace uvar nodes (Tm_uvar/U_unif) with their solutions.

The return value of this function should *never* contain a lambda. This
applies to every component of the term/sigelt: attributes, metadata, BV
sorts, universes, memoized free variables, substitutions, etc.

This is done to later dump the term/sigelt into a file (via
OCaml's output_value, for instance). This marshalling does not handle
closures[1] and we do not store the UF graph, so we cannot have any
lambdas and every uvar node that must be replaced by its solution (and
hence must have been resolved).

Eliminating the substitutions and resolving uvars is all done by the
`compress` call at the top, so this all looks like a big identity
function.

[1] OCaml's Marshal module can actually serialize closures, but this
makes .checked files more brittle, so we don't do it.
