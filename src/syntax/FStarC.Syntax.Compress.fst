(* deep_compress_*: eliminating all unification variables and delayed
substitutions in a sigelt. We traverse the entire syntactic structure
to evaluate the explicit lazy substitutions (Tm_delayed) and to replace
uvar nodes (Tm_uvar/U_unif) with their solutions.

The return value of this function should *never* contain a lambda. This
applies to every component of the term/sigelt: attributes, metadata, BV
sorts, universes, memoized free variables, substitutions, etc.

This is done to later dump the term/sigelt into a file (via OCaml's
output_value, for instance). This marshalling does not handle
closures[1] and we do not store the UF graph, so we cannot have any
lambdas and every uvar node that must be replaced by its solution (and
hence must have been resolved).

Eliminating the substitutions and resolving uvars is all done by the
`compress` call in the implementation of Visit.visit_tm, so this all
looks like a big identity function.

[1] OCaml's Marshal module can actually serialize closures, but this
makes .checked files more brittle, so we don't do it.
