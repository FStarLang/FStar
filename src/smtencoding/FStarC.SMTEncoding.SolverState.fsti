module FStarC.SMTEncoding.SolverState
(**
  This module is an abstraction of state of the SMT solver, expressed in terms of the facts
  that are visible to it currently.

  As such, it also encapsulates the various notions of filtering the facts that
  are sent to the solver, including:

    - Filtering with unsat cores
    - Context pruning
    - Filtering using the using_facts_from setting

  This interface is purely functional: every operation takes the current state and 
  optionally returns a new one, in case the state changes.

  Note, this module does not directly call the SMT solver itself: That is
  handled in FStarC.SMTEncoding.Z3.fst. Instead, it buffers all Term.decls to be
  sent to the solver and a call to flush returns all the decls to be sent.
