module FStarC.SMTEncoding.Pruning
(**
  This module provides support for the '--ext context_pruning' feature.

  It maintains a `pruning_state`, a collection of SMT assumptions.

  Given a set of root SMT declarations, it computes the set of assumptions
  "reacahable" from those roots, i.e., computing a pruning of the state to only
  include the facts that are relevant to the roots.

  The way this works, roughly, is as following:

  The set of all reachable symbols is initially all the free variables of the
  roots and the pruned set is empty.

  A given assumption in the context is a quantified fact of the form:

    A: forall x1...xn. {:pattern (p1; ...; pk)} Q

  This assumption A is reachable if all the free variables of the patterns
  (p1;...;pk) are reachable. If so, then the free variables of Q are added to
  the set of reachable symbols, A is added to the pruned set, and the process is
  repeated until fixpoint, returning the pruned set.

  Enhancements to this basic idea support 
    - quantifiers with disjunctive patterns
    - top-level non-quantified facts
    - macros
    - and some features that are specific to F*'s SMT encoding

  Thanks to Chris Hawblitzel and Guido Mart√≠nez for design and discussions.
