(*
 * AR: When encoding abstractions that have a reifiable computation type
 *     for their bodies, we currently encode their reification
 *     Earlier this was fine, since the only reifiable effects came from DM4F
 *     But now layered effects are also reifiable, but I don't think we want
 *     to encode their reification to smt
 *     So adding these utils, that are then used in Encode.fs and EncodeTerm.fs
 *
 *     Could revisit
 *
 *     06/22: reifying if the effect has the smt_reifiable_layered_effect attribute
 *     07/02: reverting, until we preserve the indices, no smt reification
