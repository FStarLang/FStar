# This makefile is included from several other makefiles in the tree.

# It enables configurably 'silent' rules, that do not
# print output unless V=1 is set. When writing a rule, you can do as
# follows (taken from src/Makefile.boot):
#
# ocaml-output/%.ml:
# 	$(call msg, "EXTRACT", $(notdir $@))
# 	$(Q)$(BENCHMARK_PRE) $(FSTAR_C) $(SIL) $(notdir $(subst .checked.lax,,$<)) \
#                   --codegen OCaml \
#                   --extract_module $(basename $(notdir $(subst .checked.lax,,$<)))
#
# This unconditionally prints a message like '[EXTRACT FStar_Syntax_Subst.ml]'
# (`notdir` is used to omit the directory of the target) and then
# proceeds to execute the F* invocation silently (since $(Q) expands to
# "@"). However, calling the same rule with `make V=1` will still print
# the message and then print the F* invocation before executing.
#
# Besides that, when not using V=1, F* receives the --silent flag to
# reduce non-critical output.

# It also defines some other utilities for resource monitoring and
# paths manipulation for cygwin
