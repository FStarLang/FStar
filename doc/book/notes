Comparing F* to other program verifiers
.......................................

If you're coming to F* having learned about other SMT-backed
verification-oriented languages like `Dafny <dafny>`_ or `Vcc <vcc>`_,
you might be wondering if F* is really any different. Here are some
points of similarity and contrast.

**User-defined language abstractions**

Perhaps the biggest difference with other program verifiers, is that
rather than offering a fixed set of constructs in which to specify and
verify a progam, F* offers a framework in which users can design their
own abstractions, often at the level of a domain-specific language, in
which to build their programs and proofs.

More concretely, ``memcpy`` is programmed in a user-defined language
embedded in F* called :ref:`Low* <LowStar>`, which targets sequential,
imperative C-like programming model with mutable heap- and
stack-allocated memory.

There's nothing particular special about Low*. Here's


There are a few differences



The signature of ``memcpy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The type signature of ``memcpy`` is very detailed, specifying many
properties about the safety and correctness of ``memcpy``, much more
than in most other languages.

**The arguments of ``memcpy``**

  * ``len``, a 32 bit unsigned integer, or a ``uint32``

  * ``cur``, also a ``uint32``, representing the current iteration
    index, but with a constraint requiring it to be bounded by ``len``.

  * ``src`` and ``dest``, pointers to arrays of bytes (``uint8``),
    both with length at least ``len``.

**The return type and effect**

The next line ``ST unit`` states that ``memcpy`` is a function, that
may, as a side effect, read, write, allocate or deallocate memory, and
returns a value of type ``unit``---if the ``unit`` type is unfamiliar
to you, from a C or Java programmer's perspective, think of it as
returning ``void``.

**The precondition**

Now we get to the really interesting part, the ``requires`` and
``ensures`` clauses, describing the pre- and postconditions of
``memcpy``. In order to safely invoke ``memcpy``, a caller must prove
the following properties when the current state of the program is
``h``:

  * ``live h src``: The ``src`` array has been allocated in memory and
    not deallocated yet. This is to ensure that ``memcpy`` does not
    attempt to read memory that is not currently allocated, protecting
    against common violations of `memory safety
    <http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2014/07/21/memory-safety/>`_, like
    `use-after-free bugs
    <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html>`_.

  * ``live h dest``: Likewise, the ``dest`` array is also allocated
    and not deallocated yet.

  * ``disjoint src dest``: The ``src`` and ``dest`` arrays should
    point to non-overlapping arrays in memory---if they did not, then
    writing to the ``dest`` array could overwrite the contents of the
    ``src`` array.

  * ``prefix_equal h src dest cur``: The contents of the ``src`` and
    ``dest`` arrays are equal until the current iteration index
    ``cur``.

**The postcondition**

Finally, the ``ensures`` clause describes what ``memcpy`` guarantees,
by relating the contents of the memory state ``h0`` in when ``memcpy``
was called to the memory state ``h1`` at the time ``memcpy`` returns.

  * ``modifies1 dest h0 h1`` guarantees that ``memcpy`` only modified
    the ``dest``

  * ``prefix_equal h1 src dest len`` guarantees that the ``src`` and
    ``dest`` arrays have equal contents all the way up to ``len``

The implementation and proof of ``memcpy``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The signature of ``memcpy`` is significantly longer than its
implementation---that's because many aspects of safety are left
implicit in the implementation and, in this simple case, the
implementation of ``memcpy`` is really quite simple. It just checks if
the ``cur`` index is still less than the length of the array, and, if
so, copies one byte over and recurses while advancing the ``cur``
position.

What's left implicit here is a proof that ``memcpy`` actually does
obey its signature. F* actually builds a mathematical proof behind the
scenes that ``memcpy`` is safe and correct with respect to its
specification. In this case, that proof is done by F*'s typechecker,
which makes use of an automated theorem prover called `Z3
<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-inner-magic-behind-the-z3-theorem-prover/>`_
behind the scenes. As such, if you're willing to trust the
implementations of F* and Z3, you can be confident that ``memcpy``
does exactly what its specification states, i.e., that the signature
of ``memcpy`` is a *mathematical theorem* about all its executions.

Compiling ``memcpy`` for execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

F* provides several ways to compile a program to other languaegs for
execution, including support to compile programs to OCaml, F#, C and Wasm.

In this case, using a tool called `KaRaMeL
<https://github.com/FStarLang/karamel>`_, a compiler used with F*, we
get the following C code for ``memcpy``.

.. literalinclude:: MemCpy.c
   :language: c

Notice that the code we get contains no additional runtime checks: the
detailed requires and ensures clauses are all gone and what's left is
just a plain C code. Later we'll see how to actually write loops, so
that you're not left with recursive functions in C. The point is that
all the proof and specification effort is done before the program is
compiled, imposing no runtime overhead at all.


..

   It is closely related to several other languages, including other
   dependently typed languages like `Coq <https://coq.inria.fr>`_, `Agda
   <agda>`_, `Idris <idris>`_, and `Lean <lean>`_, and other SMT-based program
   verification engines, like `Dafny <dafny>`_.

What makes F* unique is a combination of several elements.

* Unlike most other dependently typed languages, F* is Turing complete
  and has a notion of user-defined effects. It encourages higher-order
  functional programming, including general recursion as well as a
  user-extensible system of computational effects powerful enough to
  express mutable state, exceptions, continuations, algebraic effects
  etc.

* F* is proof assistant, in which to state and prove properties of
  programs. Dependently typed proof assistants like

* A program verification engine, leveraging SMT solvers to partially
  automate proofs of programs.

* A framework within which to embed programming languages, developing
  their semantics in a manner suitable for formal proof and enabling
  their compilation to a variety of backends, including OCaml, F\#, C,
  assembly, Wasm, etc.

* A metaprogramming system, supporting the programmatic construction
  of programs, interactive proofs, and proof automation procedures.

Many other programming languages are


Why not F*?
...........




To achieve these goals, the design of F* revolves around a few key
elements.

* A core language of total functions with full dependent types,
  including an extensional form of type conversion, indexed inductive
  types, and pattern matching, recursive functions with semantic
  termination checking, dependent refinement types and subtyping, and
  polymorphism over a predicative hierarchy of universes.

* A system of user-defined indexed effects, for modeling,
  encapsulating, and statically reasoning about various forms of
  computational effects, including a primitive notion of general
  recursion and divergence, as well as an open system of user-defined
  effects, with examples including state, exceptions, concurrency,
  algebraic effects, and several others.

* A built-in encoding of a classical fragment of F*'s logic into the
  first order logic of an SMT solver, allowing many proofs to be
  automatically discharged.

* A reflection within F* of the syntax and proof state of F*, enabling
  Meta-F* programs to manipulate F* syntax and proof goals.


Many other programming languages are closely related to F* and address
some of these goals, including other dependently typed languages like
Coq, Agda, Idris and Lean. In comparison with these languages, the
distinctive features of F* include its extensional type conversion and
SMT-based proof automation (both of which make typechecking more
flexible but also undecidable); the use of refinement types (enabling
a concise form of lightweight specification); and its user-defined
effect system.

This tutorial provides a first taste of
verified programming in F\*. More information about F\*, including
papers and technical reports, can be found on the `F\* website
<http://www.fstar-lang.org>`_.

It will help if you are already familiar with functional programming
languages in the ML family (e.g., [OCaml], [F#], [Standard ML]), or
with [Haskell]---we provide a quick review of some basic concepts if
you're a little rusty, but if you feel you need more background, there
are many useful resources freely available on the web, e.g., [Learn
F#], [F# for fun and profit], [Introduction to Caml], the [Real World
OCaml] book, or the [OCaml MOOC].

Without any experience in ML or Ocaml my experience has been that the later
exercises are very hard to solve, as some of the notation was not obvious to me. Even
knowing the correct solution, I had to either infer syntax from the exercise
code (which is fine) or go by trial and error (which was frustrating at times).
I will leave comments on the exercises detailing what kind of notation I was (or
am still) missing. Is there a resource (maybe in the wiki) that we can point
readers to, that includes examples for most of the concepts? Something like the
[F# reference] would be really helpful. Also, it might help to specify the
audience of this tutorial a bit more. As a programmer with slightly faded memory
of how inductive proofs work, the lemmas are not very straight forward. As
someone who has never seen ML or has never done any functional programming, the
syntax and some of the patterns are hard to grasp, I feel.

The easiest way to try F\* and solve the verification exercises in this tutorial is
directly in your browser by using the [online F\* editor]. You can
load the boilerplate code needed for each exercise into the online
editor by clicking the "Load in editor" link in the body of each
exercise. Your progress on each exercise will be stored in browser
local storage, so you can return to your code later (e.g. if your
browser crashes, etc).

[online F\* editor]: https://www.fstar-lang.org/run.php

You can also do this tutorial by installing F\* locally on your
machine.  F\* is open source and cross-platform, and you can get
[binary packages] for Windows, Linux, and MacOS X or compile F\* from
the [source code on github] using these [instructions].

[binary packages]: https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/releases
[source code on github]: http://github.com/FStarLang/FStar
[instructions]: https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md

You can edit F\* code using your favorite text editor, but for Emacs
the community maintains [fstar-mode.el], a sophisticated extension that adds special
support for F\*, including syntax highlighting, completion, type
hints, navigation, documentation queries, and interactive development
(in the style of CoqIDE or ProofGeneral).
You can find more details about [editor support] on the [F\* wiki].

The code for the exercises in this tutorial and their solutions are in the [F\*
repository] on Github. For some exercises, you have to include
additional libraries, as done by the provided Makefiles.
To include libraries for the Emacs interactive mode follow the
[instructions here](https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-mode.el#including-non-standard-libraries-when-using-fstar-mode).

The code available on the tutorial page and on github differs
quite a bit (as does the F\* version I guess). In my case, this lead to some
unexpected errors when copying code from the online-editor to Emacs. It would be
nice to have a pointer to the actual file and maybe the proper parameters to
verify it, in case someone prefers emacs over the online editor.

By default F\* only verifies the input code, **it does not execute it**.
To execute F\* code one needs to extract it to OCaml or F# and then
compile it using the OCaml or F# compiler. More details on
[executing F\* code] on the [F\* wiki].

<!-- CH: this is just distraction
**A note on compatibility with F\#**: The syntax of F\* and F\#
overlap on a common subset. In fact, the F\* compiler is currently
programmed entirely in this intersection. Aside from this, the
languages and their implementations are entirely distinct. In this
tutorial, we will use the full syntax of F\*, even when it is possible
to express the same program in the fragment shared with F\#. The F\*
compiler sources are a good resource to turn to when trying to figure
out the syntax of this shared fragment.
