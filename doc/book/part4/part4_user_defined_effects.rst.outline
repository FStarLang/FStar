.. _Part4_UDFX:


User-defined Effects
====================

General definitions, various classes of effects, substitutive etc.

And then backed by many examples.

A less formal, more code-centric version of the paper.

I would expect this to be quite long, with several sub-sections.

It would be nice for each section to introduce background on basic
constructions

e.g.,

a section on graded monads

a section on Dijkstra monads generalized from before, as a morphism between computational and spec monad

a section on algebraic effects, with some background on what they're good for and and how we model them

etc.





The primitive effects in F* provide a fixed specification and
reasoning mechanism for pure, ghost, and divergent
computations. :ref:`Earlier <Part2_par>` we also saw that using monads
we can model different kind of effects and specify their
semantics. For reasoning about effectful programs, however, such
semantic models may not be the right tool. Indeed several
monad-like abstractions have been proposed in the literature that are
suitable for different tasks. With user-defined effects, F* allows
building such custom abstractions and program logics, seamlessly
integrated with other features (recursion, inductive types,
...) and programmability using the same syntax that we have seen so
far. We turn our attention to user-defined effects next.
