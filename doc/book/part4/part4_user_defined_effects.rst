.. _Part4_UDFX:


User-defined Effects
====================

General definitions, various classes of effects, substitutive etc.

And then backed by many examples.

A less formal, more code-centric version of the paper.

I would expect this to be quite long, with several sub-sections.

It would be nice for each section to introduce background on basic
constructions

e.g.,

a section on graded monads

a section on Dijkstra monads generalized from before, as a morphism between computational and spec monad

a section on algebraic effects, with some background on what they're good for and and how we model them

etc.
