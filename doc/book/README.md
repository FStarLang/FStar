The book "Proof-oriented Programming in F\*" is now hosted in a separate
repository. This directory only contains F\* source files that are checked
as part of our test suite.

You can see the [book sources here](https://github.com/FStarLang/PoP-in-FStar).

You can also read an [online PDF version](https://fstar-lang.org/tutorial/proof-oriented-programming-in-fstar.pdf)
or use the [interactive online tutorial](https://fstar-lang.org/tutorial/).
