%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The pre- and postcondition logic for our dependently typed effectful language that we use to study the witness-recall verification model
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

(* we use the same logic for both the language without reify-recall and with reify-recall *)

This is classical first-order predicate logic extended with:
- a preorder on states and typed equality on values
  (so only values can appear in specifications, as in old-F*)
- witnessed predicates

Logical formulae:
-----------------

  phi, psi, ::= P(v_1,...,v_n)                  (* atomic predicate symbols *)
  pre, post   | phi /\ psi
              | True
              | phi \/ psi
              | False
              | phi ==> psi
              | forall x:t.phi
              | exists x:t.phi
              | witnessed x.phi                 (* the witnessed token *)

  P ::= rel : state,state                       (* preorder on states *)
      | ==  : t,t                               (* equality predicate, for every type (t) *)

We write (x.phi) for predicates over states.

We write (pre) and (post) for pre- and postcondition formulae when used in the computation type.

We often write

  (pre s) for (pre[s/x_s])

and

  (post s v s') for (post[s/x_s][v/x_v][s'/x'_s])

for better readability.

We also define convenient syntactic shorthands:

  stable x.phi =def= forall y,y':state . p[y/x] /\ rel y y' ==> p[y'/x]

  ~(phi)       =def= phi ==> False


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Well-formedness rules for pre- and postcondition formulae
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Well-formed formulae are defined using the judgement

  G |- phi wf

using the following rules:

  P : t_1,...,t_n
  G |- v_i : t_i   (1 <= i <= n)
  ------------------------------ [Atomic-Predicate]
  G |- P(v_1,...,v_n) wf

    In particular,

      G |- s_1 : state
      G |- s_2 : state
      ------------------- [Relation]
      G |- rel s_1 s_2 wf

      G |- v_1 : t
      G |- v_2 : t

Admissibility of cut in the sequent calculus
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Theorem (Admissibility of cut in sequent calculus):
---------------------------------------------------

The following rule is admissible in this sequent calculus:

  (a) G | Phi |- phi , Psi
  (b) G | Phi , phi |- Psi
      --------------------
  (c) G | Phi |- Psi

Proof:
------

  (* The cut admissibility proof extends that of S. Negri and J. von Plato in "Cut Elimination in the Presence of Axioms". *)

  (* For standard logical connectives we only discuss representative examples because these cases are the same for S. Negri and J. von Plato. *)

  By well-founded induction on the lexicographical order on

    (   size(phi)   ,   height(a) + height(b)   )

  by considering the following cases (organised into groups of similar derivations):

  Group 1: Either the derivation of (a) or (b) ends with [Hyp-SC].

    1) The derivation of (a) ends with [Hyp-SC] and (phi) is active.

       In this case, (a) is of the form (G | Phi' , phi |- phi , Psi) and

                     (b) is of the form (G | Phi' , phi |- Psi)

       As a result, we can pick the derivation of (b) as the derivation of (c).  

    2) The derivation of (a) ends with [Hyp-SC] and (phi) is not active.

       In this case, (a) is of the form (G | Phi' , phi' |- phi' , phi, Psi) and

                     (b) is of the form (G | Phi' , phi' |- phi' , Psi)

       As a result, we can construct (c) simply as

         Lemma (Sequent calculus relates well-formed formulae)             Lemma (Sequent calculus relates well-formed formulae)
         -----------------------------------------------------             -----------------------------------------------------
         G | Phi' , phi' |- wf                                             G | Psi wf
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Hyp-SC]
         G | Phi' , phi' |- phi' , Psi

    3) The two cases for when (b) ends with [Hyp-SC] are analogous.

  Group 2: The derivation of (a) ends with a right rule, the derivation of (b) ends with a left rule, and (phi) is active.

    For example, let us consider the case when (a) ends with [Implication-Right] and (b) ends with [Implication-Left].

    In this case, (a) is of the form

      (a') G | Phi , phi1 |- phi2 , Psi
           ------------------------------ [Implication-Right]
      (a)  G | Phi |- phi1 ==> phi2 , Psi
    
    and (b) is of the form

      (b')  G | Phi |- phi1 , Psi
      (b'') G | Phi , phi2 |- Psi
            ------------------------------ [Implication-Left]
      (b)   G | Phi , phi1 ==> phi2 |- Psi

    First, we weaken (b') to get (b''') given by (G | Phi |- phi1 , phi2 , Psi), with (height(b') = height(b''')).

    Next, as (size(phi1) < size(phi1 ==> phi2)), we can use the induction hypothesis as follows:

      (b''') G | Phi |- phi1 , phi2 , Psi
      (a')   G | Phi , phi1 |- phi2 , Psi
             ---------------------------- (* induction hypothesis *)
      (c')   G | Phi |- phi2 , Psi

    Finally, as (size(phi2) < size(phi1 ==> phi2)), we can use the induction hypothesis as follows:

      (c')  G | Phi |- phi2 , Psi
      (b'') G | Phi , phi2 |- Psi
            --------------------- (* induction hypothesis *)
      (c)   G | Phi |- Psi

  Group 3: The derivations of (a) and (b) both end with [Witnessed-Functoriality-SC], and (phi) is the active (witnessed x.phi') token.

    In this case, (a) is of the form

      (a')   G |- Phi' wf
      (a'')  G |- Psi' , witnessed x.psi' wf
      (a''') G , x:state | Phi' , psi |- phi' , witnessed x.psi' , Psi'

Theorem (Inverting [Witnessed-Funcotirality-SC] in the sequent calculus):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a derivation for

  G | Phi , witnessed x.phi |- witnessed x.psi

  where every formula in (Phi) is an atomic predicate, i.e., of the form (v_1 == v_2) or (rel s_1 s_2), 

then we have a derivation for

  G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi

Proof:
------

  We proceed by observing that because (Phi) consists of atomic predicates, (G | Phi , witnessed x.phi |- witnessed x.psi) can only end with the following rules:

  Case [Witnessed-Functoriality-SC]:

    In this case, the given derivation ends with 

      G |- Phi wf
      G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi
      -------------------------------------------- [Witnessed-Functoriality-SC]
      G | Phi , witnessed x.phi |- withessed x.psi

    As a result, the required derivation of

      G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi

    follows immediately from the premise of the above derivation.

  Case [Equality-Refl-SC]:

    In this case, the given derivation ends with 

      G |- v : t
      G | Phi , v == v , witnessed x.phi |- witnessed x.psi
      ----------------------------------------------------- [Equality-Refl-SC]
      G | Phi , witnessed x.phi |- witnessed x.psi

    As a result, we can use the induction hypothesis on

      G | Phi , v == v , witnessed x.phi |- witnessed x.psi

    to get a derivation of

      G , x:state | Phi , v == v , phi |- psi

    Finally, we can use this derivation with [Equality-Refl-SC] to get

                       induction hypothesis
                       --------------------
      G |- v : t       x \not\in Vars(G)
      ---------------------------------- (* wk *)
      G , x:state |- v : t                                     G , x:state | Phi , v == v , phi |- psi
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [Equality-Refl-SC]
      G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi

    To get (x \not\in Vars(G)) we

      a) first use Lemma (Judgements only relate well-formed syntax) on (G , x:state | Phi , v == v , phi |- psi) to get (|- G , x:state wf), and then

      b) inspect the possible derivations of (|- G , x:state wf) to get that (x \not\in Vars(G)).

  Case [Equality-Transport-SC]:

    In this case, the given derivation ends with 

      G |- v_1 : t
      G |- v_2 : t
      G | Phi' , P(v'_1,...,v'_n)[v_2/x] , witnessed y.phi |- witnessed y.psi
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [Equality-Transport-SC]
      G | Phi' , v_1 == v_2 , P(v'_1,...,v'_n)[v_1/x] , witnessed y.phi |- witnessed y.psi

    First, observe that (P(v'_1,...,v'_n)) must be of the form (v''_1 == v''_2) or (rel s_1 s2), for some v''_1, v''_2, t'', s_1, s_2.

    As a result, we can simply use the induction hypothesis on

      G | Phi' , P(v'_1,...,v'_n)[v_2/x] , witnessed y.phi |- witnessed y.psi

    to get a derivation of

    G | Phi , rel s_1 s_2 , rel s_2 s_3 |- \/_{psi \in Psi} psi

  Next, for [Sum-Disjoint-SC] the given derivation ends with

    G |- v_1 : t_1
    G |- v_2 : t_2
    G |- Phi wf
    G |- Psi wf
    ----------------------------------- [Sum-Disjoint-SC]
    G | Phi , inl v_1 == inr v_2 |- Psi

  and we prove in the natural deduction that

    Lemma (Sequent calculus relates well-formed formulae) 
    -----------------------------------------------------
    G |- Phi , inl v_1 == inr v_2 wf                                                Lemma (Sequent calculus relates well-formed formulae)
    -------------------------------------------------- [Hyp]                        -----------------------------------------------------
    G | Phi , inl v_1 == inr v_2 |- inl v_1 == inr v_2                              G |- Psi wf

    G | Phi , inl v_1 == inr v_2 |- False                                           G |- \/_{psi \in Psi} psi wf
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [False-Elim]
    G | Phi , inl v_1 == inr v_2 |- \/_{psi \in Psi} psi

  Next, for [First-Projection-SC] and [Second-Projection-SC], the proof proceeds as in the cases of [Equality-Transport-SC] and [Rel-Trans-SC].

  Finally, for [Witnessed-Functoriality-SC] the given derivation ends with

    G |- Phi wf
    G |- Psi wf
    G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi , Psi
    -------------------------------------------------- [Witnessed-Functoriality-SC]
    G | Phi , witnessed x.phi |- withessed x.psi , Psi

  and we prove in the natural deduction that

    induction hypothesis
    --------------------------------------------------------
    G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi \/ \/_{psi' \in Psi} psi'
    ------------------------------------------------------------ [Implication-Intro]
    G , x:state | Phi |- phi ==> (psi \/ \/_{psi' \in Psi} psi')
    -------------------------------------------------------------- (* a classical tautology, see below *)
    G , x:state | Phi |- (phi ==> psi) \/ (\/_{psi' \in Psi} psi')
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* [Forall-Intro] under \/ *)
    G | Phi |- (forall x . phi ==> psi) \/ (forall x . \/_{psi' \in Psi} psi')
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* [Forall-Elim] using the non-emptyness assumption on the type state, under \/ *)
    G | Phi |- (forall x . phi ==> psi) \/ (\/_{psi' \in Psi} psi')
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* [Witnessed-Functoriality] under \/ *)
    G | Phi |- (witnessed x.phi ==> witnessed x.psi) \/ (\/_{psi' \in Psi} psi')
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* a classical tautology, see below *)
    G | Phi |- witnessed x.phi ==> (witnessed x.psi \/ (\/_{psi' \in Psi} psi'))
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* cut and [Implication-Elim] *)
    G | Phi , witnessed x.phi |- witnessed x.psi \/ (\/_{psi' \in Psi} psi')

  The classical tautology we used in the above derivation is proved (in general) as the following two implications.

  On the one hand, we have

                             (a)                   (b)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (* cut with [Or-Elim] *)
    G | Phi , phi1 \/ ~(phi1) , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3                 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (* cut with [LEM] *)
    G | Phi , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3

  where the derivation (a) is given by

     G |- Phi , phi2 , phi1 wf
     ----------------------------- [Hyp]
     G | Phi , phi2 , phi1 |- phi2                                  G |- Phi , phi3 wf
     ------------------------------- [Implication-Intro]            ---------------------- [Hyp]
     G | Phi , phi2 |- phi1 ==> phi2                                G | Phi , phi3 |- phi3
     ----------------------------------------- [Or-Intro-1]         ----------------------------------------- [Or-Intro-2]
     G | Phi , phi2 |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3                      G | Phi , phi3 |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* cut with [Or-Elim] *)
     G | Phi , phi2 \/ phi3 |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3
     ------------------------------------------------------------------- (* cut with [Implication-Elim] *)
     G | Phi , phi1 , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3

  and where the derivation (b) is given by

    G |- Phi , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) , phi1 wf
    G |- phi2 wf
    G | Phi , False , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) , phi1 |- False
    --------------------------------------------------------- [False-Elim]
    G | Phi , False , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) , phi1 |- phi2
    ----------------------------------------------------------------- (* cut with [Implication-Elim] *)
    G | Phi , phi1 ==> False , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) , phi1 |- phi2
    ----------------------------------------------------------------- (* = *)
    G | Phi , ~(phi1) , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) , phi1 |- phi2
    ------------------------------------------------------------ [Implication-Intro]
    G | Phi , ~(phi1) , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) |- phi1 ==> phi2
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------- [Or-Intro-1]
    G | Phi , ~(phi1) , phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3) |- (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3

  On the other hand, we have 

    G |- Phi , phi2 wf
    ---------------------- [Hyp]
    G | Phi , phi2 |- phi2                                                              G |- Phi , phi3 , phi1 wf
    -------------------------------------- (* cut with [Implication-Elim] *)            ---------------------------- [Hyp]
    G | Phi , phi1 ==> phi2 , phi1 |- phi2                                              G | Phi , phi3, phi1 |- phi3
    ---------------------------------------------- [Or-Intro-1]                         ------------------------------------- [Or-Intro-2]
    G | Phi , phi1 ==> phi2 , phi1 |- phi2 \/ phi3                                      G | Phi , phi3 , phi1 |- phi2 \/ phi3
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (* cut with [Or-Elim] *)
    G | Phi , (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3 , phi1 |- phi2 \/ phi3
    ------------------------------------------------------------ [Implication-Intro]
    G | Phi , (phi1 ==> phi2) \/ phi3 |- phi1 ==> (phi2 \/ phi3)

  Note: This classical tautology is only used because we have chosen to work with classical logic
  and thus the RHS of the sequent calculus's validity judgement contains a set of formulae,
  rather than a single formula. If we would have used intuitionistic logic instead, we would have
  been able to use [Witnessed-Functoriality] directly on (G , x:state | Phi , phi |- psi).
