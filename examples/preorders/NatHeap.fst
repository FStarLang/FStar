open FStar.Preorder

(* Heap is a tuple of a source of freshness (the no. of the next 
   reference to be allocated) and a mapping of allocated raw 
   references (represented as natural numbers) to types and values. *)

(* NB: (a:Type0 & a) instead of dtuple2 is better notation *)

module F = FStar.FunctionalExtensionality

let heap = h:(nat & (F.restricted_t nat (fun _ -> (option (dtuple2 Type0 (fun a -> a))))))
		       {(forall (n:nat) . n < fst h ==> (exists v . snd h n == Some v)) /\ 
			(forall (n:nat) . n >= fst h ==> snd h n == None)}


(* Consistency of heaps. aka, no strong updates *)

let consistent (h0:heap) (h1:heap) : GTot Type0 =
  forall n x y . (snd h0 n == Some x /\ snd h1 n == Some y)  ==> dfst x == dfst y


(* References. *)

let ref (a:Type) = nat

//type aref =
//  | Ref : a:Type -> r:ref a -> aref

(* Containment predicate on heaps. *)

let contains (#a:Type) (h:heap) (r:ref a) : GTot Type0 =
  exists x . snd h r == Some (| a , x |)

//NB: Some? (snd h r), would avoid the existential, but would not capture the type equality

//NB: match snd h r with | Some (| b, _ |) -> a == b | _ -> False
//    this style would avoid the existential

//NB: Although, it appears that the existential variable actually seems to help in this case
//    would be good to understand why (at some point)
