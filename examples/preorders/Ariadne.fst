// CF: We model the Ariadne protocol for state continuity.
// https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_strackx.pdf
//
// The protocol ensures that, as the SGX enclave gets stopped or
// its machine crashes, it can be reliably resumed in its last saved
// state. The protocol relies on
// - a trusted monotonic counter (implemented in hardware, intuitively expensive to increment)
// - a trusted fixed key (also implemented in hardware, used for authenticated encryption)
// - an untrusted but reliable store on the host, to save encrypted counters & states
