(** Parse a notation into a matching problem and a continuation.

Pattern-matching notations are of the form ``(fun binders… -> continuation)``,
where ``binders`` are of one of the forms ``var …``, ``hyp …``, or ``goal …``.
``var`` binders are typed holes to be used in other binders; ``hyp`` binders
indicate a pattern to be matched against hypotheses; and ``goal`` binders match
the goal.


A reduction phase is run to ensure that the pattern looks reasonable; it is
needed because F* tends to infer arguments in β-expanded form.

The continuation returned can't directly be applied to a pattern-matching
solution; see ``interp_abspat_continuation`` below for that. **)
