(* This module provides an instance of an `hs_lens` for monotonic
   buffers, allowing viewing a hyperstack containing a buffer as just
   a sequence of the buffer's contents.
   
   This is the main "leaf" instance of an `hs_lens`, since (almost)
   all mutable types in LowStar are expressed via monotonic buffers
   (referring to a sequence) or pointers (referring to a single
   element).

   This module multiplexes between the buffer and pointer views as "two
   flavors".

   Note, Low* also supports `ref` types, which are essentially
   equivalent to pointers. For uniformity, we recommend using `pointer`
   instead of `ref`.  *)
