(** Now for some pure examples **)

  z:int

/// Followed by bit of boilerplate (which would be nice to metaprogram)
/// to define lenses for each of its components

(** Now some clients that use the lenses **)

/// Or, using the accessor notation

/// Or, of course, using the built-in notation
/// ...
/// So,this doesn't look like much progress so far : )

(** Now lets add more layers of objects **)

/// Here's an RGB color

/// And a `colored a` is a `color` and an `a`

/// Boilerplate
let color (#a:Type) : lens (colored a) rgb = {

}
let payload (#a:Type) : lens (colored a) a = {
  get = (fun p -> p.payload);
  put = (fun z p -> {p with payload=z})
}

/// And you can build longer lenses to reach into an object quite easily
let moveUp' (c:colored circle) (offset_y: int) =
    c.[payload |.. center |.. y] <- c.[payload |.. center |.. y] + offset_y

/// You can also build other kinds of lens combinator
/// For example, focusing on two different parts of an object at once
let ( || ) (l1:lens 'a 'b) (l2:lens 'a 'c) : lens 'a ('b & 'c) = {
