(*> * Should this be in the stdlib?
    * I see why [assert false] doesn't work in the [[]] branch of the match
      (there's no contradiction unless the implication is taken into account)?
      Is there a lightweight way to make it explicit that we're proving [False ==> …]
      in that branch? I'm thinking of an equivalent of Coq's [intro; exfalso;
      assumption].
    * Is it worth writing it with two exists instead of a single exist on a pair?
    * Why do I need anything from 'classical'?  Is it because memP uses a
      classical [or]?
    * Why is [or_elim]'s 2nd argument implicit?
    * Does F* do induction automatically? I expected I'd have to supply
      [memP_append x t] explicitly to [exist_elim].  If I wanted to do that,
      would I have to use [get_proof] + [bind_squash]? *)

(* NS: June 07, 2017
   The previous "proof" here was relying on a bug revealed by issue #1071
   It had unresolved unification variables in a recursive function,
   so the proof wasn't actually complete. 
   So, this is a revised proof ... still in an overly explicit, 
   rather unsatisfactory style.

   This version may answer some of the questions above. *)

    - Just seeing the lemma calls made it hard to remember which facts were

      feedback.  In previous proofs I used [<:] to write these annotations, but
      here I had to use explicit [assert]s ([<:] and [assert_norm] broke type
      inference).  The problem is that these asserts are rather costly (they
      make the proof slower).  Is there a way around this?
