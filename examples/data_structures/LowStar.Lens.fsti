module LowStar.Lens
open FStar.HyperStack.ST
module B = LowStar.Buffer
module HS = FStar.HyperStack

(* This module provides a more abstract way of verifying Low*
   programs.

   Rather than working directly with hyperstacks, one can reason via a
   `lens` that provides a view of a hyperstack as a store containing
   just a n-tuple of a user's choice.

   The main technical idea is to use a lens-indexed effect, `LensST`,
   a thin layer on top of FStar.HyperStack.ST.Stack, which allows
   writing specification using just the view on the hyperstack, rather
   than the full hyperstack itself, while also systematically
   enforcing the invariants of the lens.

   So far, we do not require the full generality of lenses. However,
   the framework is setup to permit moving in that direction, should
   we need it.

   We focus primarily on the `get` operation, to support viewing a
   hyperstack fragment more abstractly and operations that mutate the
   hyperstack are specified in terms of `get` operation on the new
   state rather than a `put`.

   The main type of this module is an `hs_lens a b`, a hyperstack
   lens. The first index `a` is typically some set of "roots" into a
   hyperstack, e.g, one or more pointers. The second index `b` is the
   view of the hyperstack reachable from those roots.

   An `hs_lens` also encapsulates various invariants on the
   hyperstack, e.g., the liveness of the roots etc. and is done in a
   way to enable composition via products: i.e., given an `h1:hs_lens
   a b` and `h2:hs_lens c d`, under suitable separation conditions,
   one can build a product lens `hs_lens (a & c) (b & d)`.

   Finally, the module provides the hs_lens-indexed effect `LensST`.

    put b2 (put b1 a) == put b2 a

  put: put_t 'a 'b;
  lens_laws: squash (
    get_put get put //  /\

(* Now, we work towards defining `hs_lens`, a lens on hyperstacks *)

/// `imem inv`:
///
/// A refinement of hyperstacks satisifying the invariant `inv`
/// We will mainly use lenses between `imem inv` and some type `a`
let imem inv = m:HS.mem{inv m}

let eloc = Ghost.erased B.loc

/// `as_loc`: Coercing an `eloc` to a `loc`
let as_loc (x:eloc) : GTot B.loc = Ghost.reveal x

(* Rather than the lens laws, more useful in the Low* setting are laws
   that describe the action of `get` and `put` in terms of existing
   Low* concepts, e.g., footprints in terms of `loc`; modifies clauses
   etc.  *)

  l:lens (imem inv) b {
    get_reads_loc loc l.get /\
    put_modifies_loc loc l.put /\
    invariant_reads_loc inv loc
  }

(* A distinctive feature of the setup here is the encapsulation of
   modifies clauses. See the definition of the `RST` effect for more
   details on how it is used.

   The main idea is that when creating an `hs_lens`, we record within
   it a memory snapshot. All state modifications are stated with
   respect to this snapshot, rather than relating the pre/post states
   of each sub-computation. This frees client programs from reasoning
   about the transitive composition of the modifies clauses.
