(** Unfolding **)
(* We do not want overloading to get in the way of verification, here's a first
   attempt at how to unfold methods properly. There's logic in the typechecker
   to unfold everything marked with @tcnorm just after phase 1. *)

    elem : unit -> a;

(* mark with tcnorm. we need to write it as a match and not call the
 * projector since the projector won't unfold (but it could..., maybe
 * we need an UnfoldAttrFully?) *)

(* This will only succeed if the found instance is inlined, sa
 * can be seen from the failure if one uses --tcnorm false *)
