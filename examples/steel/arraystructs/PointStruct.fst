(** A struct is encoded by what amounts to a list of (field name, typedef) pairs.
    In this example, we define a struct named point with two u32 fields; to do so
    we need a typedef for u32s, which can be found in Steel.C.StdInt. *)

module T = FStar.Tactics

(** To enforce nominality, structs are labelled by struct tags, which
    are represented by strings encoded as F* types. This encoding allows
    struct tags to stick around after erasure to OCaml.
    
    TODO the normalization is only needed for extraction, and so it
    should be possible to use postprocess_for_extraction_with instead
    of normalize. However, at present it seems that
    postprocess_for_extraction_with does not run on definitions of
    type Type. *)

(** point_fields is a representation of the list of (field name,

    detailed explanation for why this list is constructed using
    fields_cons and fields_nil rather than as a normal F* list, see

(** There is some flexibility in how these definitions can be constructed.
    Below, we define
      struct line { struct point first; struct point second; };
    but split the list of (field name, typedef) pairs across two
    definitions: .second is declared in the definition below, while
    .first is declared "inline" in the call to mk_c_struct parsed by
    Karamel.

    This code is just to illustrate that extraction is fairly
    flexible: all Karamel cares about is that the call to mk_c_struct
    normalizes (under rules norm_c_typedef) to a valid struct
    definition. In practice, it isn't recommended to split the list of
    fields like this. *)
