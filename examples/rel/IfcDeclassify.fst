(* Simple example illustrating an IFC property that needs to be stated
   in terms of an instrumented monad. *)

(* We define a variant of the state effect where the state has 3 fields:
   - a secret integer cell
   - a public integer cell
   - a boolean: when this is set the secret integer is declassified
                and allowed to leak to the public cell *)
