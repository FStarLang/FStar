(* do the F* ASTs of id and idp' look different at all?
  No. It seems that the F* AST does not even have a place to store the
  binders appearing before '=''.
  It seems that there is such a place in the ML AST.

  We should try move the head lambdas in the body of a let to the LHS of '=''
  This is what Coq seems to be doing.

  NS: I disagree. Let bindings bind a value, period.
      Their RHS can be any value, including a lambda.

(* This is even more complicated. what does Coq do about it?
   What it does is similar to the above case. Instead of applying unit (to vec),
   it applies  Obj.t (to list).

  Perhaps the general theme is that we retain type parameters, even
    if they have type other than Type.
  Indeed, while translating type type abbreviations or inductive types,
  we just copy the list of binders and don't even look at the types of binders.

  Of course, after the translation, all binders have type Type.
  So, one has to be careful while instantiating those binders.
  In particular, one has to apply more arguments before instantiating.
  If the arguments are terms, unit should usually work, because
  term-dependencies are removed in type definitions.

  In case the arguments are types, Obj.t seems to be the only thing that
  can be cooked from thin air, and it is what Coq seems to be doing.
  Is this mentioned somewhere in the thesis?

  All this seems a bit arbitrary, although is perhaps inspired by some
  use cases in Coq, and has been heavily tested (in Coq).
  Yet, Why is this the right way, conceptually?

  Our current implementation makes these same choices as Coq's.
