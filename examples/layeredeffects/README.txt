These examples show how to create and use layered_effects in F*. These
effects could be more appropriately called indexed effects (the terms are
currently used synonymously in F*). For more information on these effects see
the paper at https://www.fstar-lang.org/papers/indexedeffects.

Section 4: correct binary formatting

* LowParseWriters.fsti and LowParseWriters.fst define the Write effect
  with Hoare pre and postconditions

* LowParseWriters.NoHoare.fst defines a TWrite effect without pre and
  postconditions, which corresponds to the Write effect in the paper

* everparse/*.fst corresponds to the integration with EverParse parser
  combinators, with LowParseWriters.Test.fst containing the small
  examples of the paper and LowParseWriters_Test.c being the
  corresponding extracted C code

* everparse/tls corresponds to the TLS ClientHello extensions example (4.2):

  - Negotiation.Writers*Aux* are meant to be generated by EverParse
    (integration ongoing)

  - Negotiation.Writers.NoHoare.fst is the source file that defines
    the function writing the list of ClientHello extensions

  - Negotiation_Writers_NoHoare.c is the C code extracted (this file
    will not compile alone, it needs HACL* and miTLS)
