Initial experiment with SL tactics:

FStar.SL.Monotonic.Heap, FStar.SL.Heap: heap for sl, derived from FStar.Heap, but adding notions of restrict, join, points_to, etc.
Lang.fst: a deeply embedded language, with shallow wps, where the wp combinators are defined using small footprints
SL.Tactics.fst: Tactics for solving the wps
Examples.fst: Examples of proofs using the tactics (swap, rotate, etc.)


Scaling the experiment:

SepLogic.Heap: miniature sl heap, without many unnecesary components (mm, rel, ...)
Shallow.fst: realization of wp combinators in Lang.fst
SL.Effect.fst: sl state monad as an F* effect
