(*
 * An encoding of separation logic in F*.
 * We consider a deeply embedded language of commands and write a wp transformer that computes
 * the wp in separation logic style.
 * Then we manipulate those wps using tactics for finding the frames.
 * Once the wps become "first-order" (after the existentials for heap frames have been solved),
 * they are then sent to Z3.

(*
 * The wp that we compute for a command only talks about the footprint of the command.

 *
 * Given the input heap h0, we partition it into h0' and h0'', run the command on h0', resulting in h1',
 * and return the final heap as join h1' h0''.
