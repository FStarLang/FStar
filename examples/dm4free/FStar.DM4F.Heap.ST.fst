(* A state monad with local state built using FStar.DM4F.Heap.

   The very end of the file illustrates how recursion through the heap
   is forbidden because of the universe constraints.

   As such, in this model, storing stateful functions in the heap is
   forbidden. However, storing non-stateful functions, e.g,. Tot or
   Exception function in the heap is acceptable.
