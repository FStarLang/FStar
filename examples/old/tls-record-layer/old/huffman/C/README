This is an implementing of huffman coding (and decoding) taken
from the implementation of EPIC. Information from the EPIC README
is below.

EPIC (Efficient Pyramid Image Coder) is an experimental image data compression
utility written in the C programming language.  The compression algorithms are
based on a biorthogonal critically-sampled dyadic wavelet decomposition and a
combined run-length/Huffman entropy coder.  The filters have been designed to
allow extremely fast decoding on conventional (ie, non-floating point) hardware,
at the expense of slower encoding and a slight degradation in compression
quality (as compared to a good orthogonal wavelet decomposition).
