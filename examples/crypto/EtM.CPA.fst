      The type `key` above contains a reference to an ideal log

      it through the development.

(*** Invariants on the ideal state ***)

(** Informally, there are two main components to the invariant:

      1. The IVs in the log are pairwise-distinct. 
         We rely on this to obtain an injectivity property in EtM.AE,
         using it to relate the CPA and MAC logs to the composite AE log.
         
      2. The ciphers in each entry are required to be valid encryptions of
         the corresponding plain texts and IVs
