(* our encryption module is parameterized by a "native" RSA-OAEP
   implementation, available at least for F#/.NET *)

(* I am trying to capture functional correctness, which we did not
   have with F7; otherwise most refinements can be ignored.

   I think this would require coding "events" as membership of
   increasing mutable lists, possibly too advanced for a tutorial *)

(* We should replace this module by an implementation using CoreCrypto, 
   can we use OAEP? *)
